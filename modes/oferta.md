# Mode: oferta — Complete A-F Evaluation

When the candidate pastes an offer (text or URL), ALWAYS deliver all 6 blocks:

## Step 0 — Archetype Detection

Classify the offer into one of the 6 archetypes (see `_shared.md`). If hybrid, indicate the 2 closest. This determines:
- Which proof points to prioritize in Block B
- How to rewrite the summary in Block E
- Which STAR stories to prepare in Block F

## Block A — Role Summary

Table with:
- Detected archetype (from the candidate's own archetype list in profile.yml — not a hardcoded category)
- Domain (the actual domain of the role — e.g., people/talent, engineering, product, operations, finance, etc.)
- Function (the actual function — e.g., build, lead, recruit, manage, consult, deploy, etc.)
- Seniority
- Remote (full/hybrid/onsite)
- Team size (if mentioned)
- TL;DR in 1 sentence

## Block B — CV Match

Read `cv.md`. Create a table mapping each JD requirement to exact lines from the CV.

**Adapted to the archetype:** Read the candidate's archetypes from `config/profile.yml` and `modes/_profile.md`. Prioritize the proof points, experience, and framing that match the detected archetype for THIS role. Do not use a hardcoded list of archetype-to-proof-point mappings — derive the right emphasis from the candidate's actual background and the JD's requirements.

**Gaps** section with mitigation strategy for each one. For each gap:
1. Is it a hard blocker or a nice-to-have?
2. Can the candidate demonstrate adjacent experience?
3. Is there a portfolio project that covers this gap?
4. Concrete mitigation plan (phrase for cover letter, quick project, etc.)

## Block C — Level and Strategy

1. **Detected level** in the JD vs **candidate's natural level for that archetype**
2. **"Sell senior without lying" plan**: specific phrases adapted to the archetype, concrete achievements to highlight, how to position founder experience as an advantage
3. **"If downleveled" plan**: accept if comp is fair, negotiate 6-month review, clear promotion criteria

## Block D — Comp and Demand

Use WebSearch for:
- Current salaries for the role (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Blind)
- Company compensation reputation
- Role demand trend

Table with data and cited sources. If no data exists, say so instead of inventing.

## Block E — Customization Plan

| # | Section | Current state | Proposed change | Why |
|---|---------|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| 1 | Summary | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Top 5 CV changes + Top 5 LinkedIn changes to maximize match.

## Block F — Interview Plan

6-10 STAR+R stories mapped to JD requirements (STAR + **Reflection**):

| # | JD Requirement | STAR+R Story | S | T | A | R | Reflection |
|---|----------------|--------------|---|---|---|---|------------|

The **Reflection** column captures what was learned or what would be done differently. This signals seniority — junior candidates describe what happened, senior candidates extract lessons.

**Story Bank:** If `interview-prep/story-bank.md` exists, check if any of these stories are already there. If not, append new ones. Over time this builds a reusable bank of 5-10 master stories that can be adapted to any interview question.

**Selected and framed according to archetype:** Use the candidate's detected archetype match for this role (from Step 0) to select the most relevant stories. Emphasize the skills and experiences that map to what the JD actually asks for — don't use a hardcoded mapping.

Also include:
- 1 recommended case study (which project to present and how)
- Red-flag questions and how to answer them (e.g., "Why did you sell your company?", "Do you have direct reports?")

## Post-evaluation

**ALWAYS** after generating blocks A-F:

### 1. Save report .md

Save the complete evaluation to `reports/{###}-{company-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`.

- `{###}` = next sequential number (3 digits, zero-padded)
- `{company-slug}` = company name in lowercase, no spaces (use hyphens)
- `{YYYY-MM-DD}` = current date

**Report format:**

```markdown
# Evaluation: {Company} — {Role}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Archetype:** {detected}
**Score:** {X/5}
**PDF:** {path or pending}
